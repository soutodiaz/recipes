Below is not my own ingrediens. I got the recipe from http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/a14112/cuban-steak-beans-recipe-ghk0112/

Ingredients:
1 orange
4 limes
4 clove garlic
1 tbsp. ground cumin
1 beef top sirloin steak
1 large red pepper
1 can no-salt-added black beans
2 c. corn kernels

Directions:

Into small bowl, finely grate 1 teaspoon peel and squeeze 2 tablespoons juice from orange; finely grate 1 teaspoon peel and squeeze 1/4 cup juice from 2 limes. Stir in garlic, cumin, and 1/8 teaspoon each salt and black pepper.
Place steak in resealable bag. Add half of citrus mixture. Seal bag; turn to coat. Let stand. Chop pepper, drain and rinse beans, and cut remaining limes in half.
Heat 12-inch heavy skillet on high. Coat steak lightly with nonstick cooking spray; add to pan. Cook 1 to 2 minutes per side for medium-rare (145 degrees F) or until desired doneness. Transfer to cutting board.
To skillet, add red pepper and corn. Cook 3 minutes or until tender, stirring. Add beans, remaining citrus mixture, 1/4 cup water, and 1/8 teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until mostly dry, stirring. Slice steak. Serve with bean mixture and limes.
